## ü§ì Project Overview ##
Our team has worked on an existing website, Pass-It-On (https://www.passiton.org.sg/), that‚Äôs handled by The Helping Hand. 
<br>
![Pass-It-On](web-app/assets/passiton.png)

Pass-It-On connects the general public to the needy via Voluntary Welfare Organizations. Voluntary Welfare Organizations, also known as VWOs, are Family Service Centres and Senior Citizen Centres etc that take care of the needy. VWOs registered with Pass-It-On can request items that the beneficiary wants. These items are known as ‚Äúwishes‚Äù, which are found in the Wish List. If the donor wishes to donate an item that's not on the wishlist, they can submit the item throught the donation form and VWOs who require the item will reserve it. 

Current issues with the existing website include: 
* :nauseated_face: **Unappealing aesthetics**- pictures on the site are overly small and of varying sizes, making the page look very messy and disorganised. Labels of some images cannot be seem as they are overlapped by the image
* 	:open_mouth: **Ineffective presentation of information** - Important information such as difference between wishlist and donation are not clearly explained, and confused users have to scout around the website to understand how Pass-It-On works exactly. The FAQ, which was supposed to answer important questions, has the entirety of its content capitalised. This is a huge deterrent for propective donors.
* 	:dizzy_face: **Confusing elements** -  it's confusing for the user when they expect to go back to the original item page when pressing the reset button after looking at items of the selected category. Users have to go press on item list navigation bar again to see the full list of items.

:sparkling_heart:  Motivations behind our project: <br>
:sparkling_heart: 
The onset of covid has greatly threatened the livelihoods of Singaporeans, with those underprivileged being those who are most vulnerable. They are a group of people who need assistance, one of which comes in the form of a donation, be it monetary or gifting of items. 

Lamentably, since 2020, fewer Singaporeans are making donations as the general public became more concerned about their own economic security, amongst other factors, and have less time and effort to help out the less privileged. A survey conducted by Toluna revealed that the percentage of Singaporeans willing to donate dropped nearly 33%, from 32% in April 2020 to 23% in July 2020.[^1] Reasons such as the lack of resources such as time and money were given. 

With this worrying trend in mind, our group feels that it is imperative to work on encouraging greater donation rates to help the underprivileged.

Specific target group and country: 
* Donors in Singapore who have items that are brand new or in working condition and would like to donate
